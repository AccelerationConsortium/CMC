<h1>Logs</h1>

- These are logs from some of the experiments we want (usually 8 sets of surfactant pairs with specific ratios with the course/fine assay).
- Not all of the logs were saved as the feature was not implemented early on.
- These logs are quite verbose, but you can see the experimental decision making in action, including the exact ratios used to make the wells and substock solutions
